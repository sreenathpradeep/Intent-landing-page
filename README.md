# Intent – Extension Landing Page

Intent is a beautiful, modern landing page for the Intent browser extension, which helps you use social media more intentionally so you can enjoy your favorite sites without losing track of time.

## 🌟 Features

- **One-Click Timer:** Set a reminder for how long you want to browse (1–30 minutes).
- **Site-Wide Timers:** The timer applies to all tabs for the same site, so you can't "cheat" by opening a new tab.
- **Gentle Popups:** Friendly, non-intrusive reminders help you stay on track.
- **Customizable:** Choose your timer duration and easily extend or cancel as needed.
- **Works Across Tabs:** Timer continues even if you refresh or open new pages on the same site.
- **No Data Collected:** Your browsing data stays private—Intent never tracks what you do.
- **Beautiful Design:** Clean, modern popups and timers that blend into your browsing experience.
- **Supports Major Sites:** Works on Instagram, X (Twitter), Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, YouTube, and more.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Visit a Social Media Site:** When you open Instagram, X (Twitter), Facebook, Reddit, or other supported sites, Intent gently asks if you meant to visit.
2. **Set Your Intention:** Choose to set a timer (1–30 minutes) for your session, or close the tab if you didn't mean to visit.
3. **Browse Mindfully:** While you browse, a small, friendly timer appears on the page, reminding you of your chosen limit.
4. **Get a Gentle Reminder:** When your time is up, Intent pops up and asks if you want to extend your session or close the tab.
5. **Stay in Control:** You can always cancel the timer, extend your time, or close the tab at any point.
